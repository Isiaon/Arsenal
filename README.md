Docker is an effective way to configure, deploy, and use offensive security tools. 

Dockerizing offensive security tools provides the following benefits:

* Consistent setup and configuration (Even complicated tools can be setup with 1 command)
* Documented setup process (Dockerfiles)
* Deployable to cloud services (e.g. recon scans, c2 infra, team services)

## Usage

* Attacking - Information and commands for Attacking Docker and Kubernetes
* Commands - Commands for running Docker and Kubernetes
* Resources - Docker and Kubernetes Resources
* Setup - Information about setting up Docker and Kubernetes
* Tools - A directory of tools. Each tool folder contains a set of instructions on how to run the tool
