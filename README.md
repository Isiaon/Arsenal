## Containerized Offensive Security Tools

Containers are an effective way to configure, deploy, and use offensive security tools. 

Containerizing offensive security tools provides the following benefits:

* Consistent setup and configuration (Single command builds)
* Documented setup process (Dockerfiles)
* Deployable to cloud services (e.g. recon scans, c2 infra, team services)
